# Selenium sample

This is a very basic sample of Selenium automation (bare and with Yandex HTML Elements), which you can check out and try at home.

To run it, make sure you have a relatively recent Chrome web browser.
Download an appropriate chromedriver.exe from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) and adjust the path to it in SampleTest.java
